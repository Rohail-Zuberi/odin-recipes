    <h2>This is a special south asian dish called Nihari</h2>
    <p>
        Nihari is a type of Pakistani stew that is made with slow-cooked beef or lamb, and a mixture of spices. The dish is named after the Persian word "nihar," which means "morning," as it was traditionally eaten for breakfast. Nihari is typically made by simmering the meat for several hours until it is tender, and then adding a blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, chili powder, and garlic, to give the dish its characteristic flavor. The finished dish is thick and flavorful, and it is often served with roti or naan bread, and garnished with fresh herbs and lemon wedges. Nihari is a popular dish in Pakistan, and it is often served at special occasions and celebrations.
