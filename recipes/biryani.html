    <h2>This is a special south asian dish called Biryani</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani is a type of rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent.
      It is made by layering rice, meat or vegetables, and a mixture of spices,
      and then cooking the dish with steam. Biryani is typically served with
      raita, a yogurt-based sauce, and is often accompanied by a spicy curry or
      gravy. The dish is known for its rich, flavorful taste and is a staple at
      many South Asian weddings and celebrations.
